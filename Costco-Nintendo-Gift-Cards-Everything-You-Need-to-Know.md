## Free Gems for Nintendo Games: How to Unlock Them

Free gems in Nintendo games refer to in-game currency that can be used to purchase items or enhance gameplay. Some games, like *Fire Emblem Heroes* and *Animal Crossing: Pocket Camp*, offer in-game purchases that can be unlocked through the use of gems. Here are some ways to earn free gems for Nintendo games:

### 1. Participate in Special Events

Nintendo regularly hosts special in-game events, especially around holidays or the launch of new content. These events often reward players with gems or other in-game currency for completing certain challenges or objectives.

### 2. Complete Daily Tasks

In games like *Super Mario Run* or *Animal Crossing: Pocket Camp*, players are often rewarded with gems for completing daily challenges or logging in each day. These small rewards can add up over time, allowing you to accumulate a significant number of gems.

### 3. Use Nintendoâ€™s My Nintendo Program

The My Nintendo program offers rewards for users who participate in certain activities, such as buying games, completing surveys, or linking their Nintendo account to various devices. These rewards often include free gems or points that can be redeemed for in-game currency.

## Instant Update: How to Make Sure Your Gift Card is Ready to Use

One of the most frustrating things about digital gift cards is the activation process. However, Costco ensures that your Nintendo gift cards are ready to use almost immediately after you make the purchase. Hereâ€™s how to ensure your card is updated and ready for use:

### 1. Check the Packaging

When you purchase a Nintendo gift card from Costco, ensure that it has not been tampered with. The card should have a sealed backing or an activation sticker that prevents unauthorized access.

### 2. Redeem Quickly

Once you have the card in hand, go to the Nintendo eShop, log into your Nintendo account, and enter the unique code printed on the card. The funds should appear in your account immediately.

### 3. Contact Customer Support if Needed

If for some reason the card does not work immediately, contact Costcoâ€™s customer service or Nintendo support for assistance. They can help resolve activation issues or answer any questions you may have.

## How to Ensure You Receive Unused and Legitimate Gift Cards

When purchasing any digital gift card, especially online, it is essential to make sure the card is legitimate and unused. Here are some tips for ensuring youâ€™re getting a valid card:

### 1. Purchase Only from Reputable Sources

Always buy your Nintendo gift cards from trusted retailers like Costco or authorized online platforms. Avoid third-party sellers or sketchy websites that offer gift cards at a significant discount, as these could be scams or offer used cards.

### 2. Check for Secure Packaging

If you're buying physical gift cards from Costco, ensure the cards are securely packaged and the activation code is hidden beneath a scratch-off area. This prevents others from accessing your card before you redeem it.

### 3. Monitor Your Gift Card After Purchase

Once youâ€™ve redeemed the card, keep an eye on your account to make sure no unauthorized charges are made. If you notice anything suspicious, contact Nintendo support immediately.

## Conclusion

Costco Nintendo gift cards are a great way to enhance your gaming experience. Whether youâ€™re purchasing new games, downloadable content, or in-game currency, these cards are versatile and easy to use. While it might take a little effort to get your hands on free cards, using rewards programs, cashback sites, and keeping an eye out for seasonal promotions can help you score a free or discounted gift card. Always be mindful of where you purchase your cards and ensure they are unused for the best experience.
