## Tips for Ensuring You’re Using Legitimate Methods

While it’s tempting to search for free gift card codes, you should always ensure you are using legitimate methods. Here are a few tips to avoid scams:

### 1. Be Cautious of Phishing Scams

Do not trust any websites that ask for personal information like your password, email, or credit card number in exchange for a free code. Nintendo will never ask you to share your sensitive data in exchange for gift cards.

Only use sites with positive reviews or those known for offering real rewards. Avoid random or untrusted generators that promise “unlimited” codes but may end up stealing your data.

Check whether an app, website, or giveaway is verified. If a site is offering codes for free but has no user reviews or a suspicious design, it might not be legitimate.
